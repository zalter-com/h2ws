This should serve as your standard entry point in case you need one. This can also be served for all folders that do not have an index.
For example if you're using a UI framework that does frontend routing but needs to serve some files from the server.
Normally ALL of these should be served from a CDN but there are situations where you want to serve them from the server
(like the NextJS does or when you want to serve files for a specific user that are not public).

You can always use Tarhon For your UI. It's a great UI framework that is easy to use and has a lot of comments to help you make yourself
a great Design System.
